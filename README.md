# Path-Finding-Algorithms-Visualizer
A project developed in Python that visualizes different path-finding algorithms using the Pygame module. The user can create different obstacles and mazes to see how the algorithm would find a path.

# Supported Algorithms
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search

# How to Run
The Pygame module is required to run

To install it, run this command in the terminal: pip install pygame

Then run Main.py to start the program

# Future Additions
* Djikstra
* Astar
